excerpt: 'Over the last fifty years Cambridge, UK, has earned a reputation as a cluster of science and technology innovation. The role of the University of Cambridge tends to be over-emphasised in the academic literature. It undoubtedly plays an important enabling function in attracting capable people and in performing world class research, but this does not entirely explain the robustness of surrounding eco-system that has grown organically over the past few decades. The first part of this paper discusses the components of that eco-system and the scale of the scientific cluster that has emerged. In the remainder of the paper the focus lies on a type of R&D service firm, the technology development consultancy, TDC, that has played a very significant role in the growth and reputation of the Cambridge cluster. The business model operated by TDCs- financing the development of proprietary technologies that may eventually be licensed or spun out by conducting contract research for other companies- is discussed at some length. The paper argues that the TDC business model offers a variety of paths to growth and that its flexibility contributes significantly to these firms' longevity. Their role in the Cambridge cluster deserves to be better understood'
