excerpt: 'Analysis of the structure of customer satisfaction of 6 Japanese Flower retailers. This research was entirely funded by a grant from the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF). The JCSI (Japanese Customer Satisfaction Index) custom survey. The JCSI has been conducted across a variety of service industries. Large-scale, industry-wise, formal customer satisfaction (CS) survey featuring real, brick-and-mortal flower stores is rare, presumably one of the first of its kind worldwide. <Results> 1. Hibiya Kadan marked a remarkably high standard of customer satisfaction (CS), scored 80.7 out of 100 points, which is on par with top service companies such as leading luxury city hotels. High quality perception leads to excellent value perception. Despite its handsome average purchase price, Hibiya Kadan overwhelms mass retailers in the evaluation of cost performance, too. The online purchase rate is estimated to be over 9%, attaining high customer satisfaction comparable to physical shops. 2. The CS scores of the 4 mass merchandisers underperformed the average. Ssupermarkets need more emotional impetus to boost a feeling of satisfaction, as shown by the emotion indices.  3. Around 20% of flower shop customers say that they felt dissatisfied in some way during the last 1 year of purchase experience. While 5.6% of customers express their discontent, 16% remain silent. Clear return procedure may be conducive to recovery or effective complaint handling.'

# Customer satisfaction survey on Japanese Flower shops 2021.  
Customer satisfaction survey on Japanese Flower stores in 2021.  
Funded by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF).   
The JCSI (Japanese Customer Satisfaction Index) custom survey.  The JCSI has been conducted across a variety of service industries.  It is one of the largest consumer surveys in Japan.  Their model is based on the ACSI (American Customer Satisfaction Index).  
Large-scale, industry-wise, formal customer satisfaction (CS) survey featuring real, brick-and-mortal flower stores is rare, presumably one of the first of its kind worldwide.  

  
## Key findings
1. Hibiya Kadan, a specialty flower store, boasts a remarkably high standard of customer satisfaction (CS), scored 80.7 out of 100 points, which is on par with top service companies such as leading luxury city hotels.  High quality perception leads to high value perception. Despite its handsome average purchase price, Hibiya Kadan overwhelms mass retailers in the evaluation of cost performance, too. The online purchase rate is estimated to be over 9%, attaining high customer satisfaction comparable to physical shops.  
2. There may be further market opportunities in the relatively underexplored area between specialty flower stores and mass retailers.  Aoyama Flower Market (AFM) provides a successful example of such eclectic model. It achieved an above-average (73.8) score of 75.4.  AFM’s key CS indices show bimodal peaks: one consists of fans of first tier CS (approx. 20%, out of 10 classes) who appreciate quality, design and service skills, and another is comprised of the convenience-driven, third to fourth tiers with decent level of satisfaction.  
3. The CS scores of the 4 mass merchandisers underperformed the average. Text mining analysis indicates that flowers for traditional daily altarage account for more than 30% of total purchase items among the users of mass retailers. Home centre (Cainz) customers tend to weigh cost performance.  Seasonal flowers are popular among supermarket users including Aeon. It would be in their best interest for supermarkets to improve quality perception first.  Their merchandise and service need more emotional impetus to boost a feeling of satisfaction, as shown by the Delight Index.  
4. At any given store surveyed, around 20% of customers say that they felt dissatisfied in some way during the last 1 year of purchase experience.  While 5.6% of customers express their discontent, 16% remain silent.  Clear return procedure may be conducive to ”recovery” or effective complaint handling.
