excerpt: 'Analysis of the structure of customer satisfaction of 6 Japanese Flower retailers. This research was entirely funded by a grant from the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF). The JCSI (Japanese Customer Satisfaction Index) custom survey. The JCSI has been conducted across a variety of service industries. Large-scale, industry-wise, formal customer satisfaction (CS) survey featuring real, brick-and-mortar flower stores is rare, presumably one of the first of its kind worldwide. <Results> 1. Hibiya Kadan marked a remarkably high standard of customer satisfaction (CS), scored 80.7 out of 100 points, which is on par with top service companies such as leading luxury city hotels. High quality perception leads to excellent value perception. Despite its handsome average purchase price, Hibiya Kadan overwhelms mass retailers in the evaluation of cost performance, too. The online purchase rate is estimated to be over 9%, attaining high customer satisfaction comparable to physical shops. 2. The CS scores of the 4 mass merchandisers underperformed the average. Ssupermarkets need more emotional impetus to boost a feeling of satisfaction, as shown by the emotion indices.  3. Around 20% of flower shop customers say that they felt dissatisfied in some way during the last 1 year of purchase experience. While 5.6% of customers express their discontent, 16% remain silent. Clear return procedure may be conducive to recovery or effective complaint handling.'
