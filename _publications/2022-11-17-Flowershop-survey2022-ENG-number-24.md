excerpt: 'We asked customers of 9 flower/plant retailers in Japan about their purchasing behaviors and evaluations of the shops they use. The 9 outlets surveyed include florists, supermarkets, home improvement centers, net shops and compound shops. N=1005 in total. This research was funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF), Japan, and conducted by the Council for Japanese Flower Production and Distribution Enhancement. [Contents] Purchase frequency, average customer spending（ACS）, purchased items, reasons for use, level of affection (involvement) toward flowers and plants. Customer Satisfaction indices: Comprehensive customer satisfaction, need fulfilment, quality perception, cost-performance, emotional fulfilment, repeat purchase intention (customer loyalty), affinity with the shop (inner loyalty) and willingness to recommend Good points and areas to be improved of the store (free description). [Key findings] Overall, 48% of the respondents buy flowers and plants for home use, 39% for gifts and 23% for religious offering for the deceased. Supermarkets are characterized by the heavy reliance (approx.40%) on specific items for customary religious offerings. Average customer spending（ACS）per visit stands at 2,169 yen (1 USD=139 yen). The ACS at supermarkets is 868 yen. Specialty florists have the highest ratio of steady clientele who “always use the shop" (16%).'
