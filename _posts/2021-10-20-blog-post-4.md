## Survey overview  

### Objectives: 
This survey was planned with the aim of obtaining an objective overview of the service levels of major flower retailers from the customer's perspectives.   Such marketing data for benchmarking has been scarce for the Japanese flower industry, which is dominated by small and medium-sized entities.   

### Funding:  
This project was entirely funded by a grant from the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF).  

### Framework and modelling:  
To enable cross-sectoral comparisons across major service industries, a "custom" survey was conducted in cooperation with the Japan Productivity Center, using the framework of the Japanese Customer Satisfaction Index (JCSI), one of the largest consumer surveys in Japan.  Note that this flower shop survey is not an "official" JCSI survey.   
  
The JCSI is based on the ACSI (American Customer Satisfaction Index).  The ACSI was developed at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, and has been used by major service companies to enhance the service quality and operations.  Its CS causal model is robust and employed around the world including the JCSI. 
Large-scale, industry-wise, third party customer satisfaction surveys of flower shops, especially on real, brick-and-mortal florists, are almost unheard of worldwide, possibly the first of its kind. 

### Japanese Flower retailers:  
Six chain stores were selected.  florist or flower section of mass mass merchandiser chain store.  
- Flower specialty stores: Aoyama Flower Market (AFM) and Hibiya Kadan  
- Home centre: Cainz  
- Supermarkets: Aeon, Yaoko and Coop-Mirai  

### Respondents:  
A total of 1611 men and women in their 20s to 70s living in Japan, who have made purchases at least twice during the recent 1 year at one of the 6 companies surveyed.  

### Date and method:  
- Friday 26 February to Wednesday 3 March 2021  
- Method: Internet survey  

### Key contents:  
Customer satisfaction indices, customer delight & disappointment indices, service quality evaluation, dissatisfaction and claim recovery evaluation, word-of-mouth response (positive/negative), reasons for use, good points, evaluation of corona infection prevention measures.  Goods purchased, purchase frequency, average customer spend.  

### Key Customer Satisfaction Index (causal model) 
Main CS indices consist of 6 factors, each on a scale on which 100 is perfection:  
(1) Customer expectations -->   
(2) Perceived quality + (3) Perceived value (cost performance, or value for monetary / temporal costs)  -->  
(4) Customer satisfaction -->   
(5) Recommendation intent (Word of Mouth)  + (6) Customer loyalty (repeat purchase, increased frequency / width of purchase)  

### Note:  
It should be noted that the results of this survey cannot be regarded as representative of the flower retail industry, as the structure of flower retailing sector is highly diverse. The survey does not aim to rank individual companies. It was designed to highlight leading chains with well known practices and to present data in the hope that it will contribute to the long-term public interests, including flower shops and the flower industry.
