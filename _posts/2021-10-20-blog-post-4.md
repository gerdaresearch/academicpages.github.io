# Customer satisfaction survey on Japanese Flower shops 2021.  
Funded by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF).  
The JCSI (Japanese Customer Satisfaction Index) custom survey.  The JCSI is one of the largest consumer surveys in Japan across a variety of service industries. Their model is based on the ACSI (American Customer Satisfaction Index).  Large-scale, industry-wise, open, third-party customer satisfaction (CS) survey of flower stores, especially of real, brick-and-mortal florists, is rare, probably one of the first of its kind worldwide.  
  
## Key findings
1. Hibiya Kadan, a specialty flower store, boasts a remarkably high standard of customer satisfaction (CS), scored 80.7 out of 100 points, which is on par with top service companies such as leading luxury city hotels.
2. There may be further market opportunities in the relatively underexplored area between specialty stores and mass retailers.  Aoyama Flower Market (AFM) provides a successful example of such eclectic model.  Its CS indices show bimodal peaks: one consists of fans of first tier CS (approx. 20%) who appreciate quality, design and service skills, and another is the convenience-driven, third to fourth tiers (out of 10 classes) with decent level of satisfaction.
3. At mass retailers, text analysis indicates that flowers for traditional daily altarage account for more than 30% of total purchase items.  For supermarket users including Aeon, seasonality counts.  For supermarkets, it would be in their best interest to improve quality perception first.  Their merchandise and service need more emotional impetus to boost a feeling of satisfaction, as shown by the Delight Index.  
4. At any given store surveyed, around 20% of customers say that they felt dissatisfied in some way during the last 1 year of purchase experience.  While 5.6% of customers express their discontent, 16% remain silent. Clear return procedure may be conducive to ”recovery” or effective complaint handling.  

**Contents:** Customer satisfaction indices, customer delight & disappointment indices, service quality evaluation, dissatisfaction and claim recovery evaluation, reasons for use. Items purchased, purchase frequency, average customer spend.

# Survey overview  

### Objectives: 
This survey was planned with the aim of obtaining an objective overview of the service standards of flower retailers from the customer's perspectives.  Such marketing data for benchmarking has been scarce in the Japanese flower industry which is dominated by small and medium-sized entities.  

### Funding:  
This project was entirely funded by a grant from the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF).  

### Japanese flower stores surveyed:  
Six chain stores were selected.  
- Flower specialty stores: Aoyama Flower Market (AFM) and Hibiya Kadan  
- Home centre: Cainz  
- Supermarkets: Aeon, Yaoko and co-op Mirai  

### Respondents:  
A total of 1611 men and women in their 20s to 70s living in Japan, who have made purchases at least twice during the recent 1 year at one of the 6 companies surveyed.  

### Date and method:  
- Friday 26 February to Wednesday 3 March 2021  
- Method: Internet survey  

### Survey item: 
Customer satisfaction indices, customer delight & disappointment indices, service quality evaluation, dissatisfaction and claim recovery evaluation, word-of-mouth response (positive/negative), reasons for use, good points, evaluation of COVID-19 infection prevention measures.  Goods purchased, purchase frequency, average customer spend.  

### Framework and modelling:  
This "customised" survey was conducted in cooperation with the Japan Productivity Center, using the framework of the Japanese Customer Satisfaction Index (JCSI), one of the largest consumer surveys in Japan.  Note that this flower shop survey is not an "official" JCSI survey.  
The JCSI is based on the ACSI (American Customer Satisfaction Index) model.  The ACSI was developed at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, and has been used by major service companies to enhance their operations.  Its CS causal model is robust and employed around the world.  
JCSI's CS indexes provide a universal framework that enables benchmarking across a wide range of service industries.　
Large-scale, industry-wise, third-party customer satisfaction surveys of flower retailers including real, brick-and-mortal shops are rare, possibly one of the first worldwide.  

### Customer Satisfaction Index (causal model):  
Six factors, each on a scale on which 100 is perfection.  
(1) Customer expectations -->   
(2) Perceived quality + (3) Perceived value (cost performance, or value for monetary / temporal costs)  -->  
(4) Customer satisfaction -->   
(5) Recommendation intent (Word of Mouth)  + (6) Customer loyalty (repeat purchase, increased frequency / width of purchase)

**Note:** It should be noted that the results of this survey cannot be regarded as representative of the flower retail industry, due to the diverse structure of the sector. This survey does not aim at ranking specific companies.  It focuses on highlighting leading chains with well-known practices for benchmarking in the hope that this research will contribute to the long-term public interests as well as the flower industry.
