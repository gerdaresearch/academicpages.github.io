# Customer satisfaction survey on Japanese Flower shops 2021.  
Funded by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF).  
The JCSI (Japanese Customer Satisfaction Index) custom survey.  The JCSI is one of the largest consumer surveys in Japan across a variety of service industries. Their model is based on the ACSI (American Customer Satisfaction Index).  Large-scale, industry-wise, open, third-party customer satisfaction (CS) survey of flower stores, especially of real, brick-and-mortal florists, is rare, probably one of the first of its kind worldwide.

The JCSI (Japanese Customer Satisfaction Index) custom survey.  The JCSI has been conducted across a variety of service industries.  It is one of the largest consumer surveys in Japan.  Their model is based on the ACSI (American Customer Satisfaction Index).  
Large-scale, industry-wise, formal customer satisfaction (CS) survey featuring real, brick-and-mortal flower stores is rare, presumably one of the first of its kind worldwide.  

  
## Key findings
1. Hibiya Kadan, a specialty flower store, boasts a remarkably high standard of customer satisfaction (CS), scored 80.7 out of 100 points, which is on par with top service companies such as leading luxury city hotels.  High quality perception leads to high value perception. Despite its handsome average purchase price, Hibiya Kadan overwhelms mass retailers in the evaluation of cost performance, too. The online purchase rate is estimated to be over 9%, attaining high customer satisfaction comparable to physical shops.  
2. There may be further market opportunities in the relatively underexplored area between specialty flower stores and mass retailers.  Aoyama Flower Market (AFM) provides a successful example of such eclectic model. It achieved an above-average (73.8) score of 75.4.  AFM’s key CS indices show bimodal peaks: one consists of fans of first tier CS (approx. 20%, out of 10 classes) who appreciate quality, design and service skills, and another is comprised of the convenience-driven, third to fourth tiers with decent level of satisfaction.  
3. The CS scores of the 4 mass merchandisers underperformed the average. Text mining analysis indicates that flowers for traditional daily altarage account for more than 30% of total purchase items among the users of mass retailers. Home centre (Cainz) customers tend to weigh cost performance.  Seasonal flowers are popular among supermarket users including Aeon. It would be in their best interest for supermarkets to improve quality perception first.  Their merchandise and service need more emotional impetus to boost a feeling of satisfaction, as shown by the Delight Index.  
4. At any given store surveyed, around 20% of customers say that they felt dissatisfied in some way during the last 1 year of purchase experience.  While 5.6% of customers express their discontent, 16% remain silent.  Clear return procedure may be conducive to ”recovery” or effective complaint handling.  


**Contents:** Customer Satisfaction Indices, Customer Delight & Disappointment Indices, service quality evaluation, dissatisfaction and claim recovery evaluation, reasons for use. Items purchased, purchase frequency, average customer spend.

# Survey overview  

### Objectives: 
This survey was planned with the aim of obtaining an objective overview of the service standards of flower retailers from the customer's perspectives.  Such marketing data for benchmarking has been scarce in the Japanese flower industry which is dominated by small and medium-sized entities.  

### Funding:  
This project was entirely funded by a grant from the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF).  

### Japanese flower stores surveyed:  
Six chain stores were selected.  
- Flower specialty stores: Aoyama Flower Market (AFM) and Hibiya Kadan  
- Home centre: Cainz  
- Supermarkets: Aeon, Yaoko and co-op Mirai  

### Respondents:  
A total of 1611 men and women in their 20s to 70s living in Japan, who have made purchases at least twice during the recent 1 year at one of the 6 companies surveyed.  

### Date and method:  
- Friday 26 February to Wednesday 3 March 2021  
- Method: Internet survey  

### Survey item: 
Customer satisfaction indices, customer delight & disappointment indices, service quality evaluation, dissatisfaction and claim recovery evaluation, word-of-mouth response (positive/negative), reasons for use, good points, evaluation of COVID-19 infection prevention measures.  Goods purchased, purchase frequency, average customer spend.  

### Framework and modelling:  
This "customised" survey was conducted in cooperation with the Japan Productivity Center, using the framework of the Japanese Customer Satisfaction Index (JCSI), one of the largest consumer surveys in Japan.  Note that this flower shop survey is not an "official" JCSI survey.  
The JCSI is based on the ACSI (American Customer Satisfaction Index) model.  The ACSI was developed at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, and has been used by major service companies to enhance their service qualities.  Its CS causal model is robust and employed around the world. 
JCSI's CS indices provide a universal framework that enables benchmarking across a wide range of service industries.　
Large-scale, formal customer satisfaction surveys of flower shops, especially of real, brick-and-mortal retailers, is rare, probably one of the first of its kind worldwide. 

### Customer Satisfaction Index (causal model):  
Six factors, each on a scale on which 100 is perfection.  
(1) Customer expectations -->   
(2) Perceived quality + (3) Perceived value (cost performance, or value for monetary / temporal costs)  -->  
(4) Customer satisfaction -->   
(5) Recommendation intent (Word of Mouth)  + (6) Customer loyalty (repeat purchase, increased frequency / width of purchase)

**Note:** It should be noted that the results of this survey cannot be regarded as representative of the flower retail industry, due to the diverse structure of the sector. This survey does not aim at ranking specific companies.  It focuses on highlighting leading chain stores with well-known practices for benchmarking in the hope that this research will contribute to the long-term public interests as well as the flower industry.

# Executive Summary

## 1. Purchase data
### (1) Frequency of purchase
On average, 31.5% of users buy twice a year, while 45% buy three to four times a year.  Over 10% of the supermarket users make purchases more than once a month.  

### (2) Purchase items 
Average 23.6% of the respondents buy flowers or plants for customary religious offerings. At AFM, bouquet is mentioned by 30% of the customers.  
More than 8% of purchases at Hibiya Kadan are for gifts.  
At supermarkets, flowers for customary religious offerings at home accounts for 30-40%.  
Here, free answers about what users bought are coded and text-mined. As such, this does not provide a comprehensive quantitative data of the purchase items.  

### (3) Average customer spend (ACS) per purchase  
The total ACS stands at 2,690 yen (roughly equivalent to 23.6 USD).  Hibiya Kadan's ACS is the highest, at 5,735 yen.  
Since the minimum price option in the questionnaire is set as high as 2,000 yen, the actual ACS is estimated to be much lower.  
At Hibiya Kadan, customers are spread across a wide range of price points, from less than 2,000 yen to 20,000 yen (175.4 USD), with 3.2% of its customers making a purchase exceeding 20,000 yen.

## 2. Customer Satisfaction Indices
### (1) Hibiya Kadan  
Hibiya Kadan boasts a remarkably high standard of customer satisfaction, scored 80.7 out of 100 points. This is the outstanding level on par with top service companies such as leading luxury city hotels.  
Despite its handsome average purchase price, Hibiya overwhelms mass retailers in the evaluation of perceived value, in other words, value for money.  
<br>  

### (2) Aoyama Flower Market  
In the case of Aoyama Flower Market, the CS analysis reveals that it is an eclectic mix model of quality specialty shops (relatively large Top CS tier that accounts for more than 20% of customer base) and convenience-driven mass merchandisers (typically marked by the dominance of medium tiers with decent level of satisfaction).  The AFM's CS index histograms clearly illustrate this mixed customer bases.  
While AFM earns comparatively good perceptual quality evaluation across various segments, cost performance score remains slightly lower than average.  
Given its relatively high average CS score (75.4), second only to Hibiya Kadan, there may be potentially further market opportunities for hybrid models between specialty and mass markets.  
<br>

### (3) Home centre (Cainz)  
At Cainz, cost performance is positively correlated with customer satisfaction, as the SEM (Structural Equation Model) path analysis suggests.   
<br>

### (4) Supermarkets (Aeon, Yaoko and Co-op Mirai)  
In supermarkets, flower /plant demand for altarage offerings accounts for 30-40% of sales, but flowers of the season are also appreciated.  To improve customer satisfaction, quality perception must be improved first.  
<br>

**Table2   Average scores of Key indicators of customer satisfaction**  

| company | Customer expectations | Perceived quality | Perceived value | Customer satisfaction | Recommendation intent | Loyalty |
| :---      	| ---:  | ---:  |---:   |---:  |---:  |---:  |
| Total  	| 71.5 | 71.3 | 71.8 | 73.8 | 68.6 | 68.8 |
| AFM       	| 75.8 | 75.7 | 71.2 | 75.4 | 72.2 | 70.7 |

### (5) Frequency distribution of CS scores (histogram)
The graphs below show the distribution of the CS scores, divided into 10 classes by every 10 points. The CS histogram is one of the most important charts in this report.  Keep the shape of the distribution in mind, then it will be easier to understand the implications of other results.  

Among the mass merchandisers, the peak typically lies in the third-to-fourth from the top, medium level of satisfaction on a scale of 10.  

In stark contrast, Hibiya Kadan's CS distribution is notably high at the top 1 and 2 levels (top 2).  

AFM's CS distribution shows two peaks: the top tier (some 20%) and the medium tier.   This shape indicates that, in view of customer bases, AFM can be considered as hybrid model of specialty shops like Hibiya Kadan and mass retailers.  This trend becomes more obvious when looking at other indicators.

### (6) Bricks-and-mortar real shops vs internet retailing / mail order
The number of online and mail-order users are counted according to free answers about purchase points.  
Hibiya Kadan has a clear lead in e-commerce by a large margin, with approximately 9% of its customers buying flowers online. The second is AFM, with a modicum of 1% online users.  
Hibiya Kadan’s online channel attains a high level of customer satisfaction roughly equivalent to real shops. In terms of recommendation intent, however, Hibiya's score of online users slightly dips below real shops.  Considering that parts of the online purchases are meant for funeral or memorial services, users might have felt a certain degree of hesitation to spread word of mouth.  
Overall, probably it would not be a much stretch to say that Hibiya Kadan has been making demonstrable progress in building branding integrity across multiple channels.

### (7) The structure of customer satisfaction  
The structure of the causal relationships between indices was analyzed using structural equation modeling.  
The CS causal model posits that It starts from customer expectation to perceived quality / perceived value, then both in tandem form customer satisfaction, which is conducive to recommendation intent / loyalty.    

The numerical figures (path coefficients, within the range of ±1.0 in principle) in the path diagrams represent the strength of the influence of variables.  

At Hibiya Kadan, the path from quality to CS demonstrates a strong coefficient value as high as 0.84.  Quality is perceived as superior, which translates into the high cost performance evaluation (perceived value), strengthening the conviction that "this outstanding quality surpasses the costs."  

At Cainz, the direct effect from perceived value to CS (0.63) is comparatively strong.  Cost performance-driven CS is the characteristic of Cainz customers.  

For Aeon, the direct effect of perceived quality → customer satisfaction (0.41) is relatively high.  It is reasonable to think that raising perceived quality (66.8) level will contribute to improving customer satisfaction at Aeon.

## 3. Indexation of emotions  
### (1) Disappointment index  
The "emotion index" is a score based on a multiple scale asking the degree of disappointment and delight (10 levels each) during the purchase. Positive emotions, such as happy surprise and excitement, can boost customer satisfaction, while negative emotions, such as disappointment and anger, can quickly reduce satisfaction and ruin the good reputation that has been built up.  
The Disappointment Index consists of seven items: disappointed, annoyed, distressed, bored, irritated, uncomfortable, and worried. The higher the score, the deeper the disappointment.  
Hibiya Kadan has a low level of disappointment overall. In particular, "disappointed" (2.3) and "boring" (1.9) are kept low. Across the other five companies including AFM, disappointment is somewhat more prominent, with "disappointed" (2.7-3.0) and "boring" (2.2-2.5).  
<br>

<br>


### (2) Delight index  
Delight index consists of 9 emotions: delightful surprise, happy, fun, excited, impressed", thrilling, relaxing, reassured and peaceful.  The higher the score, the better the degree of delight.  

In terms of the emotional index, there is a marked difference between the two specialist florists and the four mass retailers. The customers of the former, Hibiya Kadan and Aoyama Flower Market, share similar emotional patterns accompanied by the deep positive emotions on multiple levels., for example, "fun" (Hibiya 7.2, AFM 7.1 out of 10 points).  

It becomes evident that services at flower specialist retailers enrich emotional life of their customers.  

The trend of Aoyama Flower Market is similar to that of mass merchandisers in terms of disappointment index and to that of specialty shops (Hibiya Kadan) in terms of delight index, which probably reflects the eclectic customer bases shown in the CS histogram patterns aforementioned.   

Mass retailers receive low marks for delight index, only 4-5 points out of 10.   There remains a huge room for developing affective components in their services.  
As some customers prefer variety and sundries, it may be important to define emotional elements to be enhanced, such as "happy" and "joyful", and then develop an integrated strategy that is consistent with the company's core values, design and MD. If successful, it may unlock the previously untapped potential in the mass market.

## 4. The level of top flower shop among the entire service industries  
The JCSI framework allows comparisons and benchmarking across various companies from diverse service sectors.  
The top flower retailer, Hibiya Kadan's CS score (80.7 on a 100-point scale) is one of the highest across the entire service industry. The specialist florist chain sweeps the all-around excellence in all 6 indices.  It goes toe-to-toe with renowned brands in the service industries such as luxury city hotels, auto dealers, restaurants, and so on.  
To achieve excellence, service companies must attain outstanding quality evaluation or excel in delivering cost-effectiveness.  Hibiya Kadan attained both.
