#### Flower shop customer survey 2022 (English version)  
The Council for Japanese Flower Production and Distribution Enhancement has conducted the flower shop user survey across in Japan.  
This is a full fledge, original survey on flower shop users’ purchase behaviors and evaluations throughout major Japanese flower retail formats. 
Flower/plant retailers surveyed include Hibiya Kadan, Aoyama Flower Market (AFM), Specialty florists (as a category), AEON, supermarket, Cainz, Home improvement center, Net shop and compound shops.  
Here, outlets that sell flowers/plants together with other items such as clothes and cafe are collectively referred to as “compound (hybrid) shops”. Given the new entrants from other sectors gaining momentum in flower retailing in Japan, capturing this emerging trend is one of the key focuses of this study.  
Funded by a grant from the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF).

## Key findings
***
### 1. Purchase behavior  
-	Overall, 48% of the respondents buy flowers and plants for home use, 39% for gifts and 23% for religious offering for the deceased.  Supermarkets are characterized by the heavy reliance (approx.40%) on specific items for customary religious offerings.  
-	Average customer spending（ACS）per visit stands at 2,169 yen (equivalent to 15.5 USD. 1 USD=139 yen). The ACS at supermarkets is 868 yen.  
-	Flower specialty shops has the highest ratio of steady clientele who “always use the shop" (16%).  
-	Customers of Hibiya Kadan, Aoyama Flower Market (AFM) and compound shops share the strong fondness for flowers and plants (each around 30%).  

####  What customers buy

### 2. Customer evaluations  
-	This research employs following 8 Customer Satisfaction (CS) related indices: Comprehensive customer satisfaction, need fulfilment, quality perception, cost-performance, emotional fulfilment, repeat purchase intention (customer loyalty), affinity with the shop (inner loyalty) and willingness to recommend.  
-	On an average basis, general specialist florists enjoy the highest overall satisfaction rate of 7.5 on a 10-point scale. The ratio of the most satisfied customers (TOP2, the sum of those who rated 9 or 10) is greater at Hibiya Kadan (31%), followed by compound shops (21%).   
-	In terms of cost performance, general florists (7.3) and Hibiya Kadan (7.2) receive excellent ratings.　Supermarkets, where ACS is at the cheapest, suffer from the lowest marks (6.2).  
-	Supermarkets earn a low mark for quality perception, too (6.0). They should prioritize quality assessment improvement first. Otherwise, it would be difficult to appeal cost-performance, i.e., value or pricing vis-a-vis quality. As some users say in free answers, “flowers are wilting at the storefront, being left uncared-for”. 
### 3. The rise of hybrid, compound shops  
-	In this research, it has become evident that compound shops outperform existing traditional flower retailers in some areas. Their CS scores of overall satisfaction, emotional fulfilment and inner loyalty are close to the levels of Japan's top florist brands.  
-	Text analysis of open-ended answers on good points suggests that in many cases, what compound shops offers are more of "service experiences” than “plants (goods)" per se.   
-	Their hybrid nature has a potential to expand "points of contact" with flowers/plants to prospective customers currently using other categories such as apparel and books, who would otherwise remain untouched.  
### 4. “Seasonal flowers” taken as most telling image of sustainability among Japanese  
-	The elements that evoke ecologically friendly association are "seasonal” flowers/plants (28%), followed by “organic/naturally grown” (24%) and “locally grown” (23%). Seasonal flowers/plants are rooted in Japanese climate and culture and seem to be naturally recognized as having low environmental/socio-economical loads.

# Survey overview  

### Objectives
This survey was planned with the aim of obtaining an overview of the purchasing behavior and evaluations of the Japanese flower shop customers across major retail formats. Such marketing data for benchmarking has been scarce in the Japanese flower industry which is dominated by small and medium-sized entities. Some leading chain stores are included so as to make it easier to get clues for benchmarking.  Ranking companies is not the purpose of this research.  

### Funding  
This project was entirely funded by a grant from the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) and carried out by the Council for Japanese Flower Production and Distribution Enhancement (previously known as the Japan Flower Vase Life Improvement Council). The Council secretariat is located at MPS Japan, a certification body.  

### Japanese flower stores surveyed  
Nine ratailers were selected.  
- Flower specialty stores: Aoyama Flower Market (AFM) and Hibiya Kadan  
- Home centre: Cainz  
- Supermarkets: Aeon, Yaoko and co-op Mirai  

### Respondents  
A total of 1005 men and women in their 20s to 50s living in Japan, who have made purchases at least once during the recent 1 year at one of the 9 retailers surveyed.
Date and method: January 31 to February 2, 2022.  Internet survey
